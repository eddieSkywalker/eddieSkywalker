- 👋 Hi, I’m @eddieSkywalker
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my developer knowledge in many different facets of technology. I really like OOP like C# and Java, but who doesn't!
- I also want to become an expert in the uses of Databases, REST/API calls, and other popular tech services. 💞️ 
- 📫 You can reach me by finding my LinkedIn at Eddie Schweitzer. :)
